we use histogram diagram analysis in this question:\\
we want hitograms of pictures to have more contrast. \\
Matlab has specific code for this problem called "histeq" that related cdf of input image to cdf pf output image .\\
but I myself developed a code that generates a linear transfer function that by means of two concept of shifing and scaling to make more contrast\\
as well, furthermore we could increase contrast by means of a logaritmic and power function\\
